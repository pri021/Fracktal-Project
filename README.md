WORKING:
This is my Project Arduino based Lie Detector where I have used a pulse sensor module to pick up pulse.
I have put up two LEDs, Green and Red which stands for Truth and Lie respectively. The output can also be viewed on the serial plotter in the arduino application, when there is a sudden change is the plot it means it's a lie.

INSPIRATION BEHIND THE PROJECT:
As a child I was very much inspired by lie detectors, I just wanted to try out if I could defeat one.
